Day 15.....few more days to go 😫

Another routine day. Morning was usual nothing out of the ordinary. Devotion, meditation, parade drills/rehearsals.

After the drills (or during), we had a servicom meeting to commission the items for our projects. It went okay, chill, nothing much to report about.

Then SAED...this one went quite the same as always. Lectures and then to the specialized classes. I didn't fight much with sleep today, I embraced it and it was a nice partnership/agreement.

We were meant to have another meeting by 2pm, immediately after the SAED classes. This one was for service innovation inauguration for our NYSC Batch. It had to be postponed because the turn up was...sigh. Anyway, we had it in the evening during the parade drills.

Then night, I think...we watched a movie (at least they played one)...I don't know the name, or what happened in the movie. I was plugged in and engaged with other stuff, so I didn't watch.

I guess that's it for today...for this entry series sha 😏

Tschüss!
