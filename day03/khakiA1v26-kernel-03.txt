Day 3...ughhh

Morning session was almost same as yesterday...extended praise session while waiting...seems like they actually need that much time.

[So I slept off while writing and missed my commit yesterday 😭😭 guess that's why I should really consider writing at intervals during the day. Anyways, I'd continue yesterday'story in today's term...]

We then rehearsed briefly for the swearing in today...we were much better at the routines, so we didn't dwell on the training. We then got an hour to prepare and return for the swearing in ceremony.

The swearing in ceremony was fine, fast actually...I expected we'd stand for hours, but it was relatively short. Took some pictures, met a few people while at it, a good day, I guess.

Other info are generic/irrelevant to feature in an entry so...

...We then went for evening parade, where we learnt some new marching processions (new moves 😉). Towards the end, the soldiers sang interesting and funny songs to lighten the mood. It was chill.

After the evening parade training, we had to wait a few eons for our platoon officer to have our meeting. We elected our "excos" during the meeting, but couldn't do much because it was late when we started (after the eons...turns out we were waiting for our platoon commander as well.) and we were chased go the multipurpose hall for (I still don't know sha) something that seemed like a video/documentary on the history/journey of the NYSC.

Then to hostel and other hostely activities, and lights out 😴


# INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS 
If you're reading this, and probably following my not so storying story, I guess I haven't said what platoon I'm in...hehe 😏😁 I'll try not to say...or maybe do one day 🤷
