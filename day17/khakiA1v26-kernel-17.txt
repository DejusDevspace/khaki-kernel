Day 17.....almost there! 🤧

I wonder how I've gone 17 days without talking about my PC or work (on here sha). I really miss my PC, and working in general. Recently now, for 2 days in a row, ChatGPT has been my most used app. I couldn't help not reading or researching 😭😭...that's by the way. Back to the day...


Morning...back to the routines. I think everything happened as it usually does. One addition is that worked out a bit 🤏...the little bit turned into morning, afternoon, and evening 🤦 my temporal abstinence from working out doesn't seem to be working, I guess.

Moving on...no SAED lectures, so we had exhibitions, presentations, and competitions from the different special classes and by platoons, too. My platoon seems to be falling off a bit here, we got just an appearance in the top three for all the competitions.

We then had a platoon meeting to sort out some internal conflict and pass some information...blah blah, and collect our "book of life" passports.

Then sport finals...platoon six won the football competition...cheers to them, they've been incognito for most of the competitions.

Then another relatively boring social night, the joy being that we closed early. 


I think that wraps it up for today...

Salut!
