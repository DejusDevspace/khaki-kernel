# 🪖 Khaki-Kernel: NYSC Orientation Logs

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Progress-yellow.svg)]()

A 21-day "runtime log" capturing the discipline, drills, and daily operations of the NYSC Orientation Camp (2026 Batch A, Stream 1). It's basically my daily journal entry (or something of the sort). Let's see how it goes...

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository serves as a digital time capsule and a commitment to consistency. During the 21-day mandatory camp period, I am documenting the transition from civilian to corps member through a series of daily system logs.

- Objective: Maintain a 21-day GitHub commit streak.
- Environment: NYSC Orientation Camp, Kubwa, Abuja, Nigeria.
- Version: 2026.A1

## 📂 File Architecture

The repository is structured by day to represent the linear progression of the "Bootcamp" program.

```bash
.
├── day01/
│   └── khakiA1v26-kernel-01.txt    # Initialization & Deployment
├── day02/
│   └── khakiA1v26-kernel-02.txt    # Early morning drills &   Registration
... # blah blah
└── day21/
    └── khakiA1v26-exit-status-0.txt # Final day (Successful Exit)
```

## 🛠 Naming Convention

- khaki: The official "environment" uniform.
- A1: Batch A, Stream 1 (The build version).
- v26: Year 2026.
- kernel: Core daily activities and system-level discipline.
- exit-status-0: Unix standard for a successful program completion without errors.
