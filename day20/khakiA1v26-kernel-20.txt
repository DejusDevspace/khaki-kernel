Day 20.....emotions emotions 

Today was another routine-like day, mostly. So the morning started off normally with devotion and meditation. We then moved on to the morning parade rehearsals (that's for those that were going to be involved in the final parade). So the usual roaming around and waiting for the parade drills to be over.

Then, we went to the multipurpose hall for a "SAED Recap". It turned out to be some information on CDS, PPA, reposting, how to act after camp, instructions on operations and communication flow during the service year, rules, stuff like that...basically a debrief. At the end, there was some kind of excitement in the air. We were finally done, and this was the last time we would be in the hall together.

Every other thing went normally, I guess, we were done from the hall at about 12pm, so there was time to rest and move around to do other things...definitely, I got some sleep after a while. Then on to the evening.

Evening...it was back to the parade rehearsals..."Final Parade Rehearsals" this time around. As usual, we stand, sit, and move around in a confined space waiting for those that are marching to be done with the rehearsals/drills.

Then, after all that, we had another "social night" that did not social night 😒. Last night should have been the last social night as it was so interesting. That should have closed off the social nights. Anyway, we listened to a message from the DG. I don't know if it was recorded or live sha.

Anyway, the Camp Commandant came up to address us (one last time) since we were making noise. He said the DG asked why the hall was noisy (that's why I think it was a live address). Being the last night, it was actually all calm in the end, and we left the hall quite early...I think before 9pm. We had the rest of the night to ourselves to rest and pack for leaving tomorrow.

I guess that's most of it for today. Nothing so much happened. 

Finally, the 21 days has come to an end.

À bientôt!
