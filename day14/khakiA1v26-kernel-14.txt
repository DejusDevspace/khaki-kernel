Day 14.....hmm

I feel this is going to be really short. A normal routine filled day, as should be. Here goes...

Morning...usual morning, devotion, meditation, parade....I guess that's pretty much it for the morning.

Then SAED...I can hardly say anything different for this. The lectures, then into our separate chosen classes. As usual, sleep and I had another duel, dangerous as always. Sleep won today though. 

Then afternoon...drills and sports, blah blah, and I guess that's it...(no energy to write 😭😭).

Evening...Mr Macho and Miss NYSC competitions. The contest was cute (only one word description working for now)...my platoon 😭😭 we won Mr Macho, and I think 2nd or 3rd place for Miss NYSC. I shouted so much that I lost my voice. 

I guess that's most of the main events. W day if you ask me.

Doei!
