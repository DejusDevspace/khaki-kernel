Day 12.....sigh 😪

Another day with little to rant about (can't get personal on here so...). So back to the not so detailed details of today.

Morning...it's Sunday, so no parade ground activities. I woke up at about 4am or 5am (I was too tired to take note of the time)..I kept going back to bed though, because why not?

8:30am (some minutes after sha), I joined my church service online...I was part of the service for a while till sleep decided I shouldn't hear anything 😭😭 after a while of struggling, I had to leave the stream and let the sleep win. 

After that, I just kept waking up at intervals till about 11am, I think. I guess I had my fair share of sleep this morning. I then used my phone aimlessly till I decided to get ready and leave the hostel. I wanted to go out on mufty, but I delayed alot and realized that there won't be enough time to come back to the hostel and change before evening parade.

So, I just got into my whites to leave the hostel. I went to the drycleaners (finally gave in to the sores from washing), and to the tailors from there to fix the buttons on my Khaki. I ate afterwards, and then went to the parade ground.

The afternoon was the normal generic routine...drills, sports, blah blah...then I decided not to go my hostel afterwards, and went to hall...sat and listened to music in a therapeutic way.

Emm...I think next was the not so social social night...it's like it keeps getting boring by the night. My highlight from good night's social night was a female comedian that really cracked me up...she really tried 👏. 

After the night out, I was compelled to eat as moral support for someone...it was calm sha. And I ate twice today 🤭 it's not so bad.

Now I'm back to my hostel, abstained from washing tonight, now I'm almost done for the night (I'm craving garri 😭😭)

Guess that's it for this entry.

À bientôt!


## EXTRA THOUGHTS
