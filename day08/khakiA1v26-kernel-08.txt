Day 8.....so far so good,  I guess.

As usual, another normal morning. This morning, I confirmed the alleged claim of the Muslim brothers and sisters waiting till about 5:45am  before commencing their prayers (p.s: we leave hostel on or before 4:30am). Then the usual devotion and parade, generic morning. Oh, yeah, a platoon started Man O' wsr drills today...I'm looking forward to that.

Then SAED 💁
Sleep got nothing on me this time because I served throughout with servicom (I was bullied by a certain someone that claims they didn't bully me into duty). It went cool though, save the fact that I felt sleepy at a point even while standing 😭😭 this sleep has been coming for my family name.
