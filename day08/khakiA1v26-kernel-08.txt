Day 8.....so far so good, I guess.

As usual, another normal morning. This morning, I confirmed the alleged claim of the Muslim brothers and sisters waiting till about 5:45am before commencing their prayers (p.s: we leave hostel on or before 4:30am). Then the usual devotion and parade, generic morning. Oh, yeah, a platoon started Man O' war drills today...I'm looking forward to that.

Then SAED 💁
Sleep got nothing on me this time because I served throughout with servicom (I was bullied by a certain someone that claims they didn't bully me into duty). It went cool though, save the fact that I felt sleepy at a point even while standing 😭😭 this sleep has been coming for my family name. 

Emm...I ate afterwards, tried watching a series but fell asleep after a short while...I slept for about 15-20 mins (give or take), then went out for sports....I think platoons 6 and 7 played, didn't pay enough attention to know who was who...it sha ended as 2-0.

Evening, started craving workouts even when I'm trying to abstain for a while due to...(blah blah...not relevant in this entry). I indulged a bit anyway (of course I did). Next was "social" night, which went as usual, the presenting platoons present, we watch, hear (or don't) and cheer them on. So social! 😒

Anyway, some details are not for here so I'd end this here...a good day, I believe.

We can do this!!! Corper weeee 😭✋️😩🤚


## EXTRA THOUGHTS
My most performed activities here are washing and bathing 😭 it's getting exhausting.
