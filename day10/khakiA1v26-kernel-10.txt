Day 10...no comments

So it's 12:10am tomorrow already...I didn't write yesterday which is like today because I'm still up...the details don't really matter.

Morning. A normal morning as usual, with the weather getting harsher by the day. Morning devotion, meditation, blah blah (I don't like routines)

Anyway, it was then time for the almighty SAED. We had a shorter session in the hall today before breaking into the practical sessions/classes. That's because today is Friday and there was Jumu'at prayer. In my class today, I was literally fighting with sleep throughout the class 😭😭 I dozed so shamelessly 😪...didn't hear much from the class obviously, but it was all good (the little I picked was fine)...then I finally was able to sleep when I got to the hostel.

The rest of the day was pretty generic.

Afternoon session was parade and sports...my platoon lost volleyball 😪 sigh...quite sad...nothing much more to say about the sports, I guess.

Then social night 🥱...dance and drama again for tonight, and they announced the winners at the end of the night. My platoon got second for drama 🤭🤭 with our 'To kill a monkey' themed drama...it was nice to get a win, finally.

I guess that's a wrap for today...I'd add any other thing I may have forgotten.

Ciao!
