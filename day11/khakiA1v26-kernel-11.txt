Day11...😪

We're halfway through now...

So I'm meant to make an entry as usual, but for some reason, I don't feel like it tonight (or right now at least), so I'll be signing off for now...I'd update this in the morning tomorrow, or if I feel up to it later tonight.

So it's tomorrow now....tomorrow evening to be precise. Guess I didn't feel like writing till now. I'm not sure I'd remember what happened yesterday in details, but here goes...

Morning...quite the same as always, the normal routine. I don't know if I mentioned earlier that we don't come out as early as before anymore....well, we don't. We now come out closer to 5am or 5am occasionally. 

Then SAED lectures again. We didn't have practicals though, and we were briefed by the camp commandant after the lectures (which ended a bit early btw).

We then went to the hostels till the evening parade...I wanted to sleep, but as usual, I opted to wash instead...my fingers have some sore injuries now because of excessive washing, so it wasn't easy but I believed I had to wash (story for tomorrow [today] but I'm taking a break on washing).

Then the rest of the evening was the normal generic evening...it was African night though, and my platoon won third place in the competition...we're stacking up wins 🤭

Well, I guess that's it for now, I don't recall much else to write about the day.

Hasta luego!

## STATUS UPDATE
I'm writing while listening to my "Emergency" Playlist. I literally forgot this Playlist existed till this evening. I need to update it though...that's it, I guess...no further comments or reasons (explanations)...blah blah...not for these entries.
