Day 7.....corper weee 😭😭

Normal morning, as usual. I realized today, why we tend to wait eons for the Muslim brothers and sisters (or why they take long...). They (allegedly) wait till the sky starts clearing up before they begin prayers.

Then SAED 🤦...today's review:
SAED isn't too bad...it's exhausting and everything everyone has said, but helpful things are being said and taught if you actually listen. I personally gained a few things today.

Then sports. The football match today (I'm ignoring volleyball because I didn't go around there) was between platoons something and mine (can't remember)...my platoon lost anyway, so I'm not dwelling on this topic 😒.

On another note, all my cords seem to be getting damaged 😭...this is about 4 cords now. The saddest one is the one I got yesterday...it's damaged already 🤦 that's just too sad. I think the issue is the narrow width of my waist bag. I'll probably stop keeping my power bank in there while I charge my phone with it, or I'll find a better way to handle it...yes, I believe I've been handling my cords poorly 😔 I'll do better.

So, evening. "Social" night today was for dance and drama competitions...I paid little to no attention to it, so I don't have more to say about it. 

Getting back to the hostel, the hostel was locked 🤦. Apparently, the caretaker wasn't around, and the hostel "Governor" also was nowhere to be found...it was quite annoying, especially because I hurried back to get things done quickly.

While waiting anyway, I went to get a new cord for my phone, hopefully for the last time. As of now, I've used it for a while, and it seems to be the best so far...little and maybe not that deep, but reaffirms one of my new mantras GOOD THINGS TAKE TIME". I got that mantra last year Decemeber when...(that's not a story for this entry).

Anyway, carried on with the rest of my night routine, and now it's time to go to bed (I hope 🤞).

I guess that's all for today.
