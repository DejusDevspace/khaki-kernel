Day 5...hmm

A very relaxed day, I guess...I'll be as short as possible because as usual, I'm exhausted.

Started the day without the morning call to the parade ground (it's Sunday 🤷). Started the day playing ball, but we (my platoon) couldn't play well and for long because we couldn't get a good space for training. We then agreed to return later in the day 12pm.

[irrelevant stuff happened]...I had a servicom meeting by 1pm, so couldn't go and play ball...choices choices...sigh.

blah blah, then drills again, then to the hall for a SAED lecture (sleep wanted to tackle me again). Got back and prepared for social night...social night happened (not so social imo sha 💁)...and that's end of the day

A short and simple day indeed.
