Well...this is my first entry on this repo. 

Today is day 1 of 21 😪 and I'm beginning to have some questions 😭...was I really excited to get here? Summary is that I was registering for 6+ hours, only to get drawn into the parade ground right after. 

Now some more (little more) info/details:

So, I got here (Kubwa camp) by some minutes past 8am (give or take), started the clearance process from the gate (bag checks and all), went to the hostel to drop my luggage, then proceeded for registration.

The registration process wasn't really stressful, just long (from my perspective)...other than how long it took, it was pretty straightforward.

So after a few stages and processes (I don't have the energy or mental fortitude to talk about those), it was time to get my Khaki 😂. Unfortunately, the Khaki (and other kit of course) for my platoon was finished. We (I and a few other guys) had to go and get new sets...that's carrying them, taking stock, blah blah...anyway, we were done and...

[short interruption before I forget - some people here (at different registration points) are so friendly, while some are...hmm🫢]

...back to the story...almost my whole kit wasn't my size 🤦 I had to start finding people to switch different clothing items with...after 30+ minutes (give or take), I was able to get a less catastrophic kit set...I'd still have to work on it (especially the khaki) a little bit more.

Moving on, after the registration, I went to the hostel and then we were made to convene at the parade ground to starting stamping the ground 😭😭 (marching, I mean). We learnt some routines, just to get a feel of things to come...and now I've solidified my claim - I DON'T WANT TO MARCH!!!.

Anyway, I'm not so willing to keep writing (I'm a bit exhausted) so...till the next entry.

## SIDE THOUGHT
Can I keep up with writing on here at the end of everyday??? I reckon I may be too exhausted on some days. Let's see how it goes...
