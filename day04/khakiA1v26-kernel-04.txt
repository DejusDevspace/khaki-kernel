Day 4...corper weee 🤭

So, since I lost my commit streak yesterday, I'm trying out the segmented updates. We're just done with the early morning sessions now. Now, the news in details 👇😂

Morning was same as always...i felt sleepy this morning for some reason (on the parade ground) and did some push-ups to get my blood flowing. 

During the session, there was swearing in of executives like the president and "members of his cabinet", platoon leaders, and then other units we could join. Anyways, I joined servicom, and we just completed our first meeting. We got briefed on the roles and benefits of servicom, elected our excos, and I guess that's pretty much it for now.

Noon was a series of lectures on security, ICT including deployment & reposting...I fought with sleep literally through the lectures...I was sooo sleepy.

Moving on, lunch, nonexistent rest, then afternoon parade. We were cautioned properly on behavior and attitude to the camping activities, accepted dressing style...that's a summary sha

Finally, the "welcome party"...I still battled with sleep here as I haven't been able to sleep through the day. It was calm sha, there was geopolitical zone acknowledgement (you'd come out and dance(

[I slept off again...at least I have the commit for the day]

I think I'll end here
