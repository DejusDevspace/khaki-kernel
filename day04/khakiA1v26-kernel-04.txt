Day 4...corper weee 🤭

So, since I lost my commit streak yesterday, I'm trying out the segmented updates. We're just done with the early morning sessions now. Now, the news in details 👇😂

Morning was same as always...i felt sleepy this morning for some reason (on the parade ground) and did some push-ups to get my blood flowing. 

During the session, there was swearing in of executives like the president and "members of his cabinet", platoon leaders, and then other units we could join. Anyways, I joined servicom, and we just completed our first meeting. We got briefed on the roles and benefits of servicom, elected our excos, and I guess that's pretty much it for now.
