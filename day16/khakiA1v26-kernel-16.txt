Day 16.....should begin a countdown 😪

Am I really still making these entries? How much longer can I keep up with documenting routines? Sigh...anyways, here goes...


Morning...this time around, we went to the multipurpose hall for the morning devotion. I wondered why....I think it's because of the nature of the lectures we were given, and that they needed to use the projector for slides.

SAED then...this was the last day of SAED lectures, and we didn't end up going to the classes because we spent most of the time for that in the hall.
