Day 16.....should begin a countdown 😪

Am I really still making these entries? How much longer can I keep up with documenting routines? Sigh...anyways, here goes...


Morning...this time around, we went to the multipurpose hall for the morning devotion. I wondered why....I think it's because of the nature of the lectures we were given, and that they needed to use the projector for slides.

SAED then...this was the last day of SAED lectures, and we didn't end up going to the classes because we spent most of the time for that in the hall.

I got a call to report to the servicom desk after the SAED lecture and I went there immediately. Noone showed up for about 20+ minutes. I left and came to my hostel...took my to do everything I wanted (except sleep), but noone called...so if I'd waited, I'd have waited to stupor 😒. Anyways, there was a call later on for members so I went. I'm too exhausted to continue with the details so...

Then next was the final parade. It was really nice to watch. Everyone seemed to be on form. My platoon came 4th anyway 😪.

On to the not so social "Social night" once more. It seems to keep getting worse (more boring) by the day...we closed early, too...I'm guessing that's because of the lack of extensive competition or activities...

I guess that wraps up the details that can be part of these entries for the day.

Chao!
