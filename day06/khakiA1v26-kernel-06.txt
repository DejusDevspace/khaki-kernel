Day 6...sigh

Emm...the day was quite boring, speaking from my first emotions when I think about the day.

Morning...same as always - morning devotion, extended singing to wait for our Muslim brothers and sisters...drills afterwards, breakfast, normal early morning routine.

Then SAED 😭😭...I don finally jam am 😭...yes, it's as bad as people said. Sleep wanted to castrate me 😭. It was sooo longg and sleep infested.

Anyways, it was then lunch, I slept a bit, the to the parade ground for sports to begin....the football match was between platoons 2 and 5, and 5 won. The volleyball, I don't know what platoons.

...blah, blah, dinner, then "social night" which was quite boring imo.

That's the end of today.


# EXTRA THOUGHTS
I realized that the summaries are getting shorter and less detailed by the day. Hope I can keep this up 🤞
