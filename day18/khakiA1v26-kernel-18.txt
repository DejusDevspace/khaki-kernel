Day 18..... no comments

Just another day at this point. The biggest question I have now is what parade we're still preparing for. Anyways, here's the details...

Morning...No devotion this morning because of the carnival...we did nothing till the carnival actually. I slept in a bit (still felt sleepy during the day 🤦), and then prepared for the carnival....apparently, I wasn't enthusiastic or excited enough to get the attires (my platoon represented the gbagyi tribe), so I just dressed up normally and literally sat through the carnival. It was all calm, I guess. Nothing much to report about it really. I think my platoon won 2nd place in just one category (I'm guessing cultural dance)...I wasn't around when the awards and positions were called out.

We (Servicom) then had a meeting where we were given some information and our CDS slips...not eventful enough for details though. 

Anyway, we still had to return to the parade ground in the evening for drills 🤦...listened to music and basically just fooled around through it. Emm...I guess that's how the afternoon/early evening went.

Then the social night 😒 tonight was the height of the annoyance from the social nights...I even left earlier than I'm meant to....couldn't sit through it anymore...mtcheeew.

Anyway, I guess that concludes another not so eventful day 🙂.

## SIDE THOUGHTS
I'm thinking about including people in my final entry (day 21), but I don't know, yet. I guess I'd find out when I get there.

A presto!
