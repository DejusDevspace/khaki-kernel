Day 9.....hmm

So this is actually the morning of day 10. I slept off before being able to write last night....it's calm though, I still have my streak because I had to make some edits yesterday. 

Moving on, as usual, morning sessions (devotion)...this one was stranger because we weren't called (chased) to the parade ground as early as usual. We got there around 5 (give or take), which was quite...idk. Anyway, devotion and the other normal activities. 

My platoon (platoon X 😏) was on duty, so no parade for today...we handled kitchen duties, sanitation, bakery stuff, security, etc...I didn't do any sha 🤫

SAED then...same old energy of sleep and exhaustion. I was on duty though, so no much fight with the sleep gods. We then broke into different classes today for practicals and I can say it was quite...just there for now.

Then sports, no clue who played because I was with my platoon Capturing and filling the book of life. No much stories to be told here sha.

Then the not so social "Social" night, to my hostel, night routine/activities, blah blah, lights out. 


## EXTRAS
I've gotten my hands sore from excessive washing 😭😭 and an injury got opened, too 😔
