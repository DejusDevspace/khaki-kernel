Day 13.....no comments

Well, a day full of routines, as usual. Here goes anyway...

Morning...same as always, I guess. My platoon did Man O' war today, so we just spoke about how prepared (or unprepared) we were for it. Devotion, meditation, stretching, and then it was time for parade. My platoon then moved for the Man O' war drills.

We were given some orientation about the importance and structure of the drills, informed about broader survival courses as well. Anyway, we went through with the drills and it was really fun. My Khaki trouser got torn 😫 and it was so silly because it got torn at a point that it should never have 🤦. Anyway, moving on...

SAED again....same old story, just that I didn't feel sleepy this time around. Rather, I got bullied into being on duty for servicom by a certain someone, again!

Anyway, it was time for the practical classes, and the venue for my class was locked and we had to wait for about an hour before relocating to another venue. The class started, and sleep came for my family name 😭😭...it was sha calm, and I don't know if I learned anything because of sleep 😪

Emm...evening then. The competition for today was Miss big, bold, and beautiful, and Mr tall, slim, and handsome. It wasn't so interesting to watch (from my perspective), but my platoon was among the top three for Mr tall, slim, and handsome (still stacking wins 😌)

Anyway, I think that's it for today (at least for the content that can be on here)...

Tchau!
